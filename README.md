In this lab, I built a fully functional User Configuration Manager that allows users to manage their settings like theme, language, volume, and notifications.

Here’s what I implemented:

✅ Add a Setting Safely add new settings, ensuring no duplicates.

 ✅ Update a Setting Modify existing settings with proper validation.

 ✅ Delete a Setting Remove settings easily, with feedback if the setting doesn’t exist.

 ✅ View Settings  Display all current settings in a clean, formatted way with capitalized keys.

I also ensured that keys and values are handled in lowercase to prevent mismatches and maintain consistency.

This lab helped me strengthen my Python skills in working with dictionaries, functions, and conditional logic, and gave me a solid example of how configuration managers work behind the scenes in real-world applications.
